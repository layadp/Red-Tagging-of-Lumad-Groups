            <h2><strong>Linear Regression Model</strong></h2>
            <p>The data was segmented according to the identified events, particularly before and after both the imposition of Martial Law in Mindanao on July 2017 and the establishment of the NTF-ELCAC on December 2018. Linear regression was performed on each region of data.</p><br>
						<img src = "linearml.png", width = "1000">
						<img src = "linearntf.png", width = "1000"><br><br>
            <p>It can be observed that the resulting p-values in each segment are less than 0.05. Thus, for all segments, no significant relationship was found between the dates the tweets were posted and the number of tweets, in relation to the 2017 Martial Law in Mindanao and the establishment of the NTF-ELCAC.</p><br>
						<p>However, this does not mean that there is no correlation between the identified events and the spread of mis/disinformation about Lumad groups. The size of the current dataset may have to be increased to provide a more definitive result. </p><br>

          <h2><strong>Event Detection Model</strong></h2>
					<p>Given the non-significance of the results of linear regression, we also used the event detection model to identify peaks in mis/disinformation tweet activity. Relevant events that coincided with each of the peaks were then identified. Generally, it can be observed that coinciding events are actions from the state and are political in nature.</p><br>
					<img src = "peak.png", width = "1000"><br><br>
					<p>The first peak corresponding to July 2017 suggests that tweets red-tagging Lumad groups may have been instigated by both Rodrigo Duterteâ€™s statement and the extension of Martial Law in Mindanao during this month. There has been fluctuating tweet activity after this initial spike in mis/disinformation tweets.</p><br>
					<p>While the establishment of the NTF-ELCAC can be considered relevant, the findings of the study did not show a strong correlation between the tweets red-tagging Lumad groups and the said event. Overall, the majority of red-tagging activity on Twitter could be attributed to news related to Lumad/Bakwit schools.</p>
